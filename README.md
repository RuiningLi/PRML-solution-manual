# PRML Solution Manual

### Motivation
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) is a well-known textbook in the field of machine learning. August 2021 marked the start of my odyssey self-studying it. In order to enhance my understanding of the topics covered in the book, I have decided to complete all exercises following each chapter.
I will publish my solution manual here as I continue to tackle the problems in the book for two reasons:

1. It will motivate me to commit more time into progressing on PRML.
2. It might be helpful for others who pursue the book in the future.

I welcome any comments on the manual. PLEASE let me know (by submitting a pull request) any errors you find!

### Timeline
2021.9.30 - So far I've read the first three chapters. I think I've understood most of the contents! (I tend to be overconfident, though.) Working on the exercises and will publish my solutions as soon as I'm done!
